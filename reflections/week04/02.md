## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

pending, resolved and rejected.

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

If we achieve to get the information from the server, the Promise will be resolved successfully. But if we donâ€™t get the information, then the Promise will be in the rejected state. this allows for us to be able to catch errors more efficiently.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

then() is if a promise is passed and a catch() is to stop at a fail.
