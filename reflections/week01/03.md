## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

 adding extra spacing is my favorite tip as it allows for you to distinguish different elements easier.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

I think paying attention to text colors and background color on designs can be helpful as it allows you to be able to read texts easier if the colors are correct.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

a good designed website allows for people to be able to navigate through easier and is more appreciated. Better design will help me develop a webiste easier as it allows for me to view what my website needs.
