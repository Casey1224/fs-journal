## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

The key difference between columns and rows is that a column arranges data vertically from top to bottom, while a row arranges data horizontally from left to right.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

A database table simply organizes the information into rows and columns. The SQL CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a table.

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

drop table completely delets the entire table
